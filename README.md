This is a small plugin for the [Pelican framework](https://getpelican.com), which generates a .htaccess file in your output folder. Currently it just looks in the current theme's root folder for one and copies it over, when Pelican generates the site.

I'll add some functionality to choose a different location (if you want to use your own for example), just gotta get around to it!

Please note that this was created for personal use, but might be helpful for others.
